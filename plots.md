# Fuel Efficiency Analysis using the MPG Dataset

This project performs basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the **MPG (Miles per Gallon)** dataset using **Matplotlib** in Google Colab.  
The dataset provides details about various car models from different origins (USA, Europe, Japan) and includes attributes such as engine size, horsepower, weight, and fuel efficiency.

## Data Source

- **Dataset Name:** MPG Dataset  
- **Source:** Seaborn built-in dataset (originally from the UCI Machine Learning Repository)  
- **Citation:**  
  *Jeffrey C. Schlimmer (1987). Concept Acquisition: Analytic and Experimental Studies of Knowledge Acquisition. Machine Learning, 2, 287â€“294.*  
- **Access Method in Colab:**
  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  df = sns.load_dataset("mpg").dropna()

## Weight vs MPG

The first observation to be made is that heavier cars have lower miles per gallon. Also as cylinder increases, cars shift toward heavier weights and lower miles per gallon.

## MPG vs number of cylinder

Car with fewer cylinders will generally have higher MPG, showing better fuel efficiency and higher-cylinder engines consume more fuel. Therefore, engine size directly affects efficiency. 

## Average MPG over the years

Here we expect to see an upward trend as cars became more fuel-efficient over time due to regulations and better technology. 

## Average MPG by origin

Japanese > Europe > USA. Japanese cars are generally more fuel efficient.
