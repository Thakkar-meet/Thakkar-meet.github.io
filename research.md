# Research Projects

## Current Research

**Improving Varying Parameter ZNN for Solving Linear Matrix Equations**  
*June 2025 – Ongoing*  
- Introduced a hyperbolic term into the ZNN design formula to improve the convergence speed.  
- Applied the proposed method to solve **Sylvester**, **Stein**, and **Lyapunov** equations effectively.

## Projects

**Modified Semantic Chunking in RAG**  
*April 2024 – May 2024*  
- Integrated **BM25** with signal processing techniques to achieve more consistent and semantically meaningful chunking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

**Neural Style Transfer**  
*November 2023 – January 2024*  
- Combined the content of one image with the artistic style of another using transfer learning techniques.  
- Implemented the model using **VGG19** and a custom **CNN** for multi-level feature extraction and reconstruction.

**Colorizing Images using Conditional GANs**  
*January 2023 – April 2023*  
- Implemented the **pix2pix** architecture for image-to-image translation using conditional GANs.  
- Focused on producing realistic and visually coherent colorizations of grayscale images.

**Hand Gesture Recognition**  
*August 2022 – November 2022*  
- Developed a real-time computer vision system for recognizing hand gestures to control system functions such as brightness and volume.  
- Implemented using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**, focusing on speed and accuracy in dynamic environments.
